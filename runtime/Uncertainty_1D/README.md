# Kantola uncertainty ensemble

The parameter-uncertainty analysis of the T&C-SMEW field paper (Zhang et
al., GCB; supplement section 4, Table S2), carried into the coupled model
with the two parameters this model adds. Three parameter sets are
compared: the original (calibrated) values, all sixteen parameters at the
lower end of their ranges, and all sixteen at the upper end. Each set
covers every treatment in 1-D and 2-D, at the standard rates and in the
5 t/ha calcite arm, over the five validation years and over the 35
projection years of each SSP.

The legacy analysis ran the ERW module standalone on the resulting
respiration range. Here the whole model runs, so the pH, nitrogen and
weathering responses carry the parameter spread together.

## Parameter sets

| parameter | meaning | lower | original | upper |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Vm | max. specific decomposition rate of MOC | 1.2 | 100 | 528 |
| Vpc | max. specific decomposition rate of POC cellulose | 4.8 | 200 | 792 |
| Km | half-saturation constant, MOC decomposition | 0.057 | 0.25 | 0.95 |
| rem | turnover rate of the MOC enzyme pools | 0.0075 | 0.018 | 0.075 |
| rep | turnover rate of the POC enzyme pools | 0.0075 | 0.018 | 0.075 |
| pepf | maintenance-respiration fraction to POC enzymes (fungi) | 0.0031 | 0.006 | 0.031 |
| mrb | maintenance rate of bacteria | 0.0012 | 0.010 | 0.03 |
| mrf | maintenance rate of saprotrophic fungi | 0.0012 | 0.005 | 0.03 |
| fd | fraction of decomposed POC to DOC | 0.2 | 0.4 | 0.8 |
| Vpl | max. specific decomposition rate of POC lignin | 4.8 | 23 | 792 |
| Vdb | max. DOC uptake rate, bacteria | 0.0024 | 0.04 | 0.06 |
| Vdf | max. DOC uptake rate, saprotrophic fungi | 0.0024 | 0.02 | 0.06 |
| FD | dissolution factor on the weathering rate law | 0.8 | 1 | 1.2 |
| exponent on the ERW pore saturation | s^2 low, sqrt(s) high | 2 | 1 | 0.5 |
| KNmaxd | denitrification rate scale, d^-1 | 0.002 | 0.0048 | 0.01 |
| alpha | Appelo exchange slope, constants slid with it | 1.3 | 3.4 | 6 |

The first fourteen rows are the legacy analysis. Ranges come from Table
S2 of the T&C-SMEW supplement, which the range comments in
`Biogeochemistry_Parameter.m` repeat. The original values are what the
model ships: the SI "original" column, except mrb and mrf, which keep the
legacy code's 0.010 and 0.005 (the SI lists 0.005 and 0.002) because
`Data_Kantola_BG.mat` was spun up with them. The workbook's dissolution
factor is 1 on every feedstock row, the SI's original.

KNmaxd and alpha are this model's additions. The KNmaxd range is an
exploratory cross-model bracket, not a confidence interval or a range
fitted to the Energy Farm chambers. Hou et al. (2024,
doi:10.3389/fpls.2024.1482292) report first-order soil denitrification
constants of 0.002-0.003 d^-1 in the upper 40 cm. CropSyst's first-order
nitrate loss (Confalonieri et al. 2006, doi:10.1051/agro:2006022) has a
0.01 d^-1 reference at 15 C (Heinen 2003, Alterra report 690). Alpha 3.4
is the Appelo (1994) proton-loading slope, the value SCEPTER carries as
its default and the campaign's since package u. No range is published for
it, so the range is likewise an exploratory bracket: the ends of the sweep
grid, 1.3 (the value fitted on 26 September) and 6. Both are formed as the
sweep forms them (the first point of `linspace(1.3,3.4,5)` and the literal
6). Moving alpha slides the exchange constants by the campaign's rule,
`logKH = reference_logKH + charge x (alpha - 1.3) x 0.20`, which keeps the
seed's measured 80 % base saturation. A set's constants are given to
twelve significant figures, the precision a result name carries: at alpha
6 the Mg constant of the rule has thirteen (10.29854858734, run as
10.2985485873) and the K constant falls a rounding error away from its
twelve-figure decimal, and either would otherwise add its hexadecimal form
to the name and take the longest 35-year 2-D name past the 255 characters
a file name may have. The sweep's own alpha 6 cases carry the unrounded
constants, so the upper set's result names are not theirs:

| alpha | Na | K | Ca | Mg | Al |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1.3 | 4.716 | 3.616 | 8.103 | 8.419 | 12.919 |
| 3.4 | 5.136 | 4.036 | 8.943 | 9.259 | 14.179 |
| 6 | 5.656 | 4.556 | 9.983 | 10.299 | 15.739 |

Alpha sets how far the bulk pH moves for a given change in base
saturation, (0.434/f_H + alpha)/100 pH units per point at an H fraction
f_H: 0.035, 0.056 and 0.082 at the seed's f_H of 0.20 for the three
values.

"Lower" and "upper" name the ends of the parameter ranges, not of any
output. The sixteen moves push a given output in different directions
(the s^2 exponent slows weathering while the low KNmaxd raises nitrate,
for example), so neither set need give an output's lowest or highest
value, and the original can fall outside the pair.

## Arms, horizons and where the results are

In package u the original set is the Base and SSP campaigns of the same
root (`TC_UC_ORIGINAL_ROOT="$PWD"`, no `TC_UC_WITH_ORIGINAL`), so it is run
once. Results of another package cannot stand in for it: the model check
below refuses a checkout whose source or inputs differ. `TC_UC_WITH_ORIGINAL=1`
remains for an ensemble kept in a root of its own, as m ran it. The lower
and upper sets run here, each over every run of an arm, with everything
else as the original's campaign ran it: the campaign's set
(`Campaign_Parameters.m`), the horizon, forcing and application years,
and for 2-D the worker count (6 at five years as `Base_2D`, 12 at 35 as
`SSP_2D`).

| horizon | arm | runs | original | lower and upper |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 5 yr, legacy forcing | 1-D | 10, 11, 12 | `Base_1D` | `Uncertainty_1D` |
| | 1-D, 5 t/ha | 12 | `Base_1D_case8` | `Uncertainty_1D_case8` |
| | 2-D | 1-9 | `Base_2D` | `Uncertainty_2D` |
| | 2-D, 5 t/ha | 3, 6, 9 | `Base_2D_case8` | `Uncertainty_2D_case8` |
| 35 yr, SSP forcing | 1-D | 10, 11, 12 | `SSP_1D_35yr_<ssp>` | `Uncertainty_1D_35yr_<ssp>` |
| | 1-D, 5 t/ha | 12 | `SSP_1D_35yr_<ssp>_case8` | `Uncertainty_1D_35yr_<ssp>_case8` |
| | 2-D | 1-9 | `SSP_2D_35yr_<ssp>` | `Uncertainty_2D_35yr_<ssp>` |
| | 2-D, 5 t/ha | 3, 6, 9 | `SSP_2D_35yr_<ssp>_case8` | `Uncertainty_2D_35yr_<ssp>_case8` |

All are directories under `v2/SIM/Subfield_12/`. The table's original
column gives the matching Base/SSP campaign directories, which hold the
original set in package u. `lower/` and `upper/` sit under each ensemble
tag (with `original/` beside them only when a call adds
`TC_UC_WITH_ORIGINAL=1`), with the 2-D logs, status files and run locks
under the same path in `v2/logs/Subfield_12/`.

The three sets compare only if they ran the same model, so the controller
first compares this checkout with the original's (`same_model_code.sh`):
`v2/T&C_Code` without its tests, the forcing and every other input in it,
`v2/run`, and the calibrated set must be byte for byte the same. Nothing
is submitted otherwise.

## Files

| file | role |
|---|---|
| `Uncertainty_Members.m` | the three sets above |
| `Uncertainty_Campaign.m` | reads `TC_SSP`, `TC_HORIZON` and `TC_CALCITE_CASE` into the arm, horizon, tags, run list, workers and array elements (member-major) |
| `Uncertainty_Knobs.m` | a set's values and its `Run_One_Subfield` options; for the original, exactly what the Base and SSP tasks pass |
| `Uncertainty_Result_Matches.m`, `Uncertainty_Result_State.m` | whether a saved result is the expected run: campaign, stamp, horizon, columns, every knob per column, and the scenario and calcite case in its name |
| `Run_Uncertainty_Task.m`, `submit_uncertainty.sbatch` | one 1-D element: one CPU, one thread |
| `../Uncertainty_2D/Run_Uncertainty_2D_Task.m`, `../Uncertainty_2D/submit_uncertainty_2d.sbatch` | one 2-D element: the SSP 2-D campaign's path, with a run lock and the lateral conservation check |
| `submit_uncertainty.sh` | the controller: the model check, then the 1-D and 2-D arrays of one horizon and case |
| `same_model_code.sh` | the byte comparison with the original's checkout |
| `requeue_near_limit.sh` | sourced by both batch files: a run requeues itself before the 24-hour limit and continues from its checkpoint |

## Submitting

`RUNBOOK_2026-09-24.md`, section 0u, gives the order for package u: the
equivalence baseline, the campaign's own 1-D runs with their validation,
then the ensemble. Submit the ensemble only after the R2025a validation of
the root has passed (the `Base1Dcheck` job).

One controller call per horizon and case, eight in all. A call submits a
1-D and a 2-D array; `TC_UC_DIMS=1d` or `TC_UC_DIMS=2d` submits that array
alone, so the five-year 1-D sets can run and be looked at first:

```bash
for c in '' 8; do TC_BOUCHET_ACCOUNT=pi_np363 TC_UC_ORIGINAL_ROOT="$PWD" TC_UC_DIMS=1d TC_SSP= TC_HORIZON= TC_CALCITE_CASE=$c bash runtime/Uncertainty_1D/submit_uncertainty.sh || break; done
```

```bash
for c in '' 8; do TC_BOUCHET_ACCOUNT=pi_np363 TC_UC_ORIGINAL_ROOT="$PWD" TC_UC_DIMS=2d TC_SSP= TC_HORIZON= TC_CALCITE_CASE=$c bash runtime/Uncertainty_1D/submit_uncertainty.sh || break; done
```

```bash
for c in '' 8; do for s in ssp126 ssp245 ssp585; do TC_BOUCHET_ACCOUNT=pi_np363 TC_UC_ORIGINAL_ROOT="$PWD" TC_SSP=$s TC_HORIZON=35yr TC_CALCITE_CASE=$c bash runtime/Uncertainty_1D/submit_uncertainty.sh || break 2; done; done
```

Resources per element, set by the controller:

| horizon | 1-D | 2-D |
|---|---|---|
| 5 yr | 1 CPU, 12 GiB, `day`, 12 h | 6 CPUs, 48 GiB, `day`, 24 h |
| 35 yr | 1 CPU, 56 GiB, `day`, 24 h per piece | 12 CPUs, 256 GiB, `day`, 24 h per piece |

Everything runs on the `day` partition. The per-user limits there, 1500
CPUs and 20 TB, are far wider than on `week` (96 CPUs and 1.5 TB, where
a 256 GiB element runs six at a time), so the ensemble does not queue
behind the Base and SSP campaigns. A day job stops at 24 hours. A 35-year
run longer than a day requeues itself when Slurm signals
the limit half an hour ahead, and continues from its last checkpoint
under the same job id, which keeps its run lock (`requeue_near_limit.sh`,
at most five restarts). Each restart loses at most the half hour since
that checkpoint. Interrupted 1-D and twelve-column 2-D runs were checked
bit for bit in k; the daily state replay and reload checks of l are recorded in
`PARTICLE_HISTORY_REVIEW_2026-09-28.md`. One
diagnostic does not carry over a restart: the plant carbon-overdraw count
a run prints and saves at its end (`carbon_deficit`) covers its last
piece only.

Without originals, each horizon has 8 one-dimensional and 24
two-dimensional elements (the standard and 5 t/ha arms together), 128
elements across both horizons and all SSPs. The six 35-year calls include
72 two-dimensional and 24 one-dimensional elements. Allow space for
their results and checkpoints, including temporary checkpoint copies:
a 35-year 2-D result is about 11 GB for a control and tens of GB for
whole-field basalt, so the 35-year sets belong in a scratch copy of the
checkout (RUNBOOK section 0v). The controller refuses a 5-year call below
100 GiB free and a 35-year call below 600 GiB, a floor only. The group
quota can be tighter than `df` shows. The 35-year 2-D elements dominate
the cost. Package u's 35-year runs measured what sets their memory: the
particle-class histories, 17 GiB per treated column held whole, put a
whole-field basalt run near 400 GiB; package v keeps those histories
daily (`PARTICLE_RECORDS_DAILY_2026-10-04.md`), which puts it near
150-200 GiB, hence 256 GiB (`TC_UC_2D_MEM` overrides it). Read the
MaxRSS of a finished whole-field basalt run before going lower. An element that runs out of
memory stops (OUT_OF_MEMORY) with its checkpoint; resubmitting the call
with more memory, once its arrays have left the queue, continues it.

`TC_UC_WITH_ORIGINAL=1` on a controller call runs the original set here
as well, first in each array, with the campaign's knobs and under the
same checks, into `original/` beside `lower/` and `upper/`. Package u does
not need it. The array grows by half; a call already submitted
without it only needs the
same call with it added once its jobs have left the queue, since
finished lower and upper elements exit at once.

After a TIMEOUT or node loss, resubmit the same command. An element whose
result already carries its set's provenance exits at once (a 2-D element
first rereads its lateral conservation), the rest continue from their
checkpoints, and a result of anything else is refused rather than
overwritten. The controller refuses while any of that call's jobs are
queued, and lists stale 2-D run locks to remove.

## Summary and figures

The summary and figures for the three-set design (per arm the original
with the lower and upper sets, 2-D domain aggregates, the 5 t/ha arm)
come with the post-processing package. For u, it must read the original
set from the Base and SSP campaign directories of the table above and
`lower/` and `upper/` under each ensemble tag. Unpack it in a root of its
own: while any element here is queued or running, or may still be
resubmitted, nothing under `runtime/`, `v2/plotting`, `v2/audit` or
`v2/T&C_Code/Tests` of this root may change, since every element's stamp
covers those files and a change discards the runs in flight. Run the
model check again before summarising.
