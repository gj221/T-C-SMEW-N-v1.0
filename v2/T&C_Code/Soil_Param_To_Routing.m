%% Soil_Param_To_Routing
%%
%% Adapt the Soil_Param struct built by Restating_parameters.m to the
%% field names Conductivity_Suction expects inside Darcy_Lateral_Topology.
%%
%% Two names differ between the two conventions and are the only reason
%% this adapter exists:
%%     Soil_Param.Ks_Zs -> sp.Ks     (saturated conductivity per layer)
%%     Soil_Param.Phy   -> sp.Phy1   (air-dry matric potential, VG only)
%% SPAR and the anisotropy ratio aR are free-standing workspace variables in
%% the parameter files, so they are passed in rather than read off the struct.
