%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% Particle-class histories of an amended column: the last few ERW days
%% whole, and the last row of every earlier day.
%%
%% psd, d, lamb, SSA and delta_d are rows x size classes x applications:
%% one row per ERW step of the whole run, one slice per scheduled rock
%% application. Over 35 years (1840896 ten-minute rows, 35 applications)
%% each is about 3.6 GB, so the five held whole took 17 GiB of memory in
%% every amended column, and every checkpoint wrote them. ERW_function
%% reads only two things from them: the previous row, and for each
%% application the first row whose last size class is positive (its
%% initial distribution, psd_0(find(psd_0(:,end,k)>0,1),:,k)). Nothing
%% else in the model, the campaign checks or the read-outs reads them.
%%
%% The rows a day writes collect in a block, so ERW_Daily_Step_2D never
%% writes into an array the frame still holds. The blocks of the last
%% keep_days days (three unless 'start' is told otherwise) stay whole.
%% When an older block is dropped, its last written row is kept at its
%% latest value. The daily windows follow one another, so every row the
%% daily step reads comes from today's block or the day before it, exactly
%% as the full arrays gave it; a window repeating the day before would be
%% served exactly too. A read of any other row, which the daily step does
%% not make, stops the run with RowNotKept instead of returning a wrong
%% value.
%%
%% After the run the frame assembles what was kept: weath.psd and the
%% others hold the rows set at initialisation and the last row of every
%% ERW day, at their latest values, and weath.particle_rows gives each
%% one's row on the ten-minute grid.
%%   [H,weath] = ERW_Particle_History('start',weath,weath_names,keep_days)
%%   day = ERW_Particle_History('open',H,first_row,n_rows)
%%   v   = ERW_Particle_History('row',H,day,weath,name,r)    row r, 1 x classes x apps
%%   F   = ERW_Particle_History('first',H,day,name)          psd or lamb

%%   H   = ERW_Particle_History('track',H,day,out,r,weath)
%%   H   = ERW_Particle_History('close',H,day)
%%   E   = ERW_Particle_History('assemble',E)
%% 'first' returns, for each application, the first row whose last size
%% class is positive (zeros where none is): ERW_function's
%% psd_0(find(psd_0(:,end,k)>0,1),:,k) gives the same row from it as from
%% the whole history, which is that application's initial distribution.
